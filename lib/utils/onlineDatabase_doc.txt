***
when an admin registers a project named <project_name>:
    1.  ☑ A value of 'project_id_counter' (col: '_app_data', doc: 'app_config') is read from firestore.
        It is assigned to the project as it's ID (<project_id>).
        Then 'project_id_counter' is incremented by 1, and sent back to firestore.
    2.  ☒ (this step is not necessary, because as participants create first idea this collection will be created)
            a new empty collection (project_<project_id>_ideas) is created.
    3.  ☑ app gets _app_data/app_config/invitation_code_counter,
        ☒ generates as many new unique invitation codes as the participants in the project,
        ☑ adds them to _app_data/invitation_codes as a key-value pair:
            key is invitation code
            value is <project_id>
    4.  ☑ adds a new doc 'project_<project_id>' to _projects_data which is structured as follows:
            {
            int project_id,
            String title,
            String description,
            String author, //Firebase user ID
            Timestamp created_on,
            Timestamp starts,
            Timestamp ends,
            String status, //ongoing, not_started_yet
            int idea_id_counter,
            Map<Map> participants = [
                Map <invitation_code> = {
                    int invitation_code,
                    String name,
                    String email,
                    List<Datetime> app_launches,
                    String status,  //consent_withdrawn
                    Datetime invitation_code_activated,
                    },
                Map <invitation_code> {.....},
                Map <invitation_code> {.....},
                ],
            }


***
when a participant enters an invitation code:
    1.  ☑app gets _app_data/invitation_codes and checks if the entered code exists:
            ☑if yes: gets project ID and saves it (<project_id>) and the code (<invitation_code>) in sharedPreferences;
            ☒if no: shows error
    2.  ☒if project setting allow entering names, app asks for it and saves to:
            participants[invitation_code][name] (at _projects_data/project_<project_id>/)

***
when a participant creates a new idea:
    1. ☑app generates new idea ID (depending on value in idea_id_counter)
    2. ☑adds a new doc 'idea_<idea_id>' to _projects_data/project_<project_id> which is structured as follows:
                   Map idea_<idea_id> = {
                       int id,
                       String title,
                       String url, //ex. link of a product on Amazon
                       String image_url,
                       String author_invitation_code,
                       String author_name,
                       Timestamp created_on,
                       List comments = [
                           Map <comment_id> = {
                               String author_invitation_code, //invitation_code
                               String comment,
                               Datetime commented_at,
                               },
                           Map <comment_id> {.....},
                           Map <comment_id> {.....},
                       ],
                       List ratings = [
                           Map <rating_id> = {
                               String author, //invitation_code
                               double rating,
                               Datetime rated_at,
                               },
                           Map <rating_id> {.....},
                           Map <rating_id> {.....},
                       ],
                   }
